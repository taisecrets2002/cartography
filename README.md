# cartography
cartography exercises where I was too mad at Excel and wrote code instead

exercise 3 is about geographical coordinates; calculating differences, angles etc for my own task. If you want to adapt to your own specific latitudes you just adapt stuff in the 'fi' string.

exercise 5 is changing geographical coordinates to (y,x) in D48/GK Slovenian old coordinate system (EPSG 3912);
We used 'sheets' of Slovenian DTK 25 (1:25000), I had the one in Kamnik and the lower left corner are the coordinates that got in fi1 & delta1. you change them and you get a different "sheets" (the size of it is 7.5' Ã— 7.5')
